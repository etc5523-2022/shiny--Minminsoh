# ETC5523 Assessment 1

This is the app developed for the ETC5523 Assessment 1. 

* The creator of this app is **Min Min Soh**.
* The data used for this assessment is obtained from `tidytuesday`,in which the link of the data can be obtained [here](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2018/2018-07-17/week16_exercise.xlsx).  

The goal of the app is in part explanatory (identify demographics factors that affect average exercise rate in US) and in part descriptive and presentation (describing and presenting the average exercise rate in the states by demographics).

The app works locally but somehow there is an issue publishing it to the shinyapps.io.  [https://etraio-min0min-soh.shinyapps.io/shiny--ETC5521assessment1--Minminsoh/](https://etraio-min0min-soh.shinyapps.io/shiny--ETC5521assessment1--Minminsoh/)
